## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

### ⚛️ Components

> React components are the building blocks of your UI. You'll learn how to write **functional components** and structure your project cleanly.

---

### 📬 Props

> Learn how to pass data between components using **props** and understand how components become truly reusable.

---

### 🧠 State

> Understand how to **manage internal component data** using the `useState` hook.

---

### 🔄 Conditional Rendering

> Render content conditionally based on data and logic (e.g., toggle a UI, render lists, or show "No items found").

---

### 🌍 Routing with `react-router-dom`

> Learn to create single-page applications with **client-side routing**, using:

- `<BrowserRouter>`
- `<Routes>` & `<Route>`
- `useParams()` for dynamic routes
- Navigating with `<Link>` and `useNavigate()`
