# ⚛️ React Fundamentals — Learnt by Doing! 🚀

This repository contains small projects I built while learning React. Each app helped me grasp different core concepts of React such as components, state, props, and routing.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

### ⚛️ Components

> React components are the building blocks of your UI. I learnt how to write **functional components** and structure your project cleanly.

---

### 📬 Props

> I learnt how to pass data between components using **props** and understand how components become truly reusable.

---

### 🧠 State & Hooks

> I understood how to use `useState`:used to manage internal component data (e.g., form input, toggle switches) &
>`useEffect`:**used to perform side effects like fetching data, updating the DOM, setting up subscriptions**

---

### 🔄 Conditional Rendering

> I rendered content conditionally based on data and logic (e.g., toggle a UI, render lists, or show "No items found").

---
### 🚀 Data Fetching with `Fetch API`

> I used traditional in-built es6 `fetch api` retrieve data from a demo **node.js** backend api

---

### 🌍 Routing with `react-router-dom`

> I learnt to create single-page applications with **client-side routing**, using:

- `<BrowserRouter>`
- `<Routes>` & `<Route>`
- `useParams()` for dynamic routes
- Navigating with `<Link>` and `useNavigate()`
